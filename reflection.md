I found this assignment easier than the first one and I didn't use ChatGPT. I didn't make major changes to the styling, I simply took what I came up with before and made it more polished with CSS. I used Bootstrap. I've used Bootstrap before so that's why I chose it. Bootstrap made implementing responsive design really easy. I didn't have to worry about when formatting should change or how to accomplish that effect. Bootstrap did it for me. The one challenge I ran into was changing the color of the navigation bar. Bootstrap doesn't make that easy and the color I chose was overridden, so I went with their default options.
