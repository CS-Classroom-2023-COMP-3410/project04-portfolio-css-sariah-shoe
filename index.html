          <h2>Creative Works I Enjoy</h2>
          <!-- I included more than just traditional novels because I love stories of all kinds -->
          <li><b>Hellblazer</b>
            <div>Hellblazer is a horror comic book series starring John Constantine.
              John Constantine is one of my favorite characters. 
              He is a flawed character with great humor as he faces unspeakable horrors.
            </div>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Sherlock Holmes</b>
            <div>I enjoy Sherlock Holmes adaptations but I find his original written version especially fascinating.
              I like the language used in older writing and the 'unfiltered' version of Holmes.
              Holmes solves crimes while on cocaine and often doesn't tell his partner anything until the story is over.
            </div>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><b>My Adventures With Superman</b>
            <div>Superman is another character I enjoy. I like the contrast between sweet Clark Kent and the unstoppable Man of Steel.
              My Adventures With Superman captures his character very well and provides fun spin-offs of characters around him.
              It both respects the comics and comes up with something new. That's a hard balance to strike.
            </div>
          </li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Detroit Become Human</b>
            <div>This is a game I recently finished playing through. It is a story-based game about androids in Detroit.
              The game doesn't pull any punches. Terrible things happen to your characters, and I like that.
              It makes me invested in the game and truly gives me the feeling that my choices matter.
              It also leaves you with a lot to think about. What makes someone human?
